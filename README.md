# SocketProject

1. Working on a simple client/server file transfer project.
...The server binds to a port and uses a threaded connection handler to handle connections
...The Client accepts local and remote filenames and then connects to the server to transfer files.
2. ToDo
..+ Add more command line options for the server and client. Like being able to specify the port on the command line.
..+ Add additional logging detail
..+ Add security. At minimum, a conf file to limit connections to networks or specific IP.
..+ Move some functionality into the module.
..+ Add Encryption as an option but make it simple.
